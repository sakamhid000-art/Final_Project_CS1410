#Final_Project_CS1410
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (SSBU) is a video game in which characters from different Nintendo franchises battle against each other. Because of the game’s popularity, a large competitive scene has developed, where players participate in tournaments to test their skills. However, for players who are new to competitive play, the rules, settings, and stage choices can be confusing and intimidating.

At Southern Utah University, we have an active competitive Smash scene where new players regularly join tournaments. Many of them are not familiar with competitive formats or which stages are best suited for their characters. My project aims to make this easier by creating a Python program that helps players find the best stage for each character in SSBU. The program will allow users to browse characters, learn about their best stages, and understand why certain stages benefit them. This tool will help newcomers feel more confident and prepared for competitive play.

To run the command-line interface, download FinalProject_CS1410.py. This file is required for both Final_Project_Tester.py and SmashGUI.py to function, so make sure it is downloaded before using either of those programs. You will need a program capable of running Python files (VS Code works well, but any Python-compatible IDE is fine). After downloading the files, open them in the application you choose. Run FinalProject_CS1410.py first to load all necessary classes and data. If you plan to use the graphical interface or the testing suite, you must also run SmashGUI.py—the tester relies on the GUI’s initialization and will not run correctly without it. Once the GUI is launched, you can run Final_Project_Tester.py to execute the test cases.

Usage Examples: 1, 3 (shows a list of characters, then exits the program) 1, 2, mr. game and watch, 3 (shows a list of characters, shows the best stage and reason for Mr. Game and Watch, then exits the program) 2, kazuya, 3 (shows the best stage and reason for Kazuya, then exits the program) 3 (exits the program)
